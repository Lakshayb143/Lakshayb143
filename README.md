# 👋 Hi, I'm Lakshay Bhatia

I'm a final-year Computer Science undergrad from DCRUST, Haryana, and also pursuing a B.Sc. in Data Science from IIT Madras. I specialize in building practical and scalable AI/ML systems — from real-time computer vision pipelines to secure adversarial defense tools and LLM-based agentic applications.
